    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Begin by cooking your rice noodles according to the package instructions. Once cooked, drain and set aside. You want them slightly firm so they don’t become mushy when stir-frying.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large pan or wok, heat your oil over medium-high heat. Add the protein (chicken, tofu, or your choice) and cook until browned and cooked through. Set the protein aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the same pan, add more oil if needed and toss in your garlic, cooking for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the vegetables (broccoli, bell pepper, and carrot) and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes, until they begin to soften but remain crisp.
        </li>
        <li>
            Push the vegetables to the side of the pan, crack the egg into the empty space, and scramble it until cooked. Once scrambled, mix it with the vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the cooked noodles back into the pan with the veggies and egg. Pour in your sauce mixture (soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar) and stir everything together, ensuring the noodles are well coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss the cooked protein back in and give everything one final stir. Let the dish cook for another minute, allowing all the flavors to meld together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve hot with a sprinkle of chili flakes for some extra heat, and enjoy your homemade Pad See Ew!
