        <h3>first steps:</h3>
        <p>Before you start cooking the wild mushroom risotto, there are a few important steps to prepare. First, clean and slice your mushrooms — you can use a mix of wild mushrooms for a richer flavor profile.</p>
        <p>You’ll need to prep your broth, either vegetable or chicken, and keep it warm on a low simmer while you cook.</p>
        <p>Additionally, get your pan ready for sautéing the onions and garlic, and measure out the rice and other ingredients so everything is within arm’s reach. </p>
        <p>This helps keep the cooking process smooth and ensures you’re ready for the next step when it’s time to add ingredients.</p>
        <p>Finally, make sure you have a wooden spoon or spatula for stirring the risotto — constant stirring is key to achieving the creamy texture.</p>
        <p>Here’s a quick checklist to get you set:</p>

        <h3>time to cook!</h3>
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Begin by heating your broth in a saucepan over low heat, keeping it warm as you cook the risotto.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large pan, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add your onions and sauté until translucent, about 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add your garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant, then toss in the sliced mushrooms. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the mushrooms soften and release their juices.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the rice, cooking for 1-2 minutes until it’s lightly toasted and coated with the oil and mushroom mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Begin adding your warm broth, one ladleful at a time, stirring constantly. Let the rice absorb the liquid before adding more broth. Continue this process for about 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is creamy and tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the rice is done, stir in the grated Parmesan and butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve the risotto hot, garnished with fresh herbs like parsley or thyme, and enjoy your wild mushroom risotto!
        </li>
